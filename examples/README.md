# Examples

The `ballerinax/notion` connector provides practical examples illustrating usage in various scenarios. Explore these [examples](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-notion/tree/main/examples), covering use cases like creating pages, retrieving users, and managing databases.

[//]: # "TODO: Add examples"

1. [Creating a new page](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-notion/blob/main/examples/CreateNewPage/main.bal)
2. [Retrieve existing pages](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-notion/blob/main/examples/RetrievePage/main.bal)

## Building the examples with the local module

**Warning**: Due to the absence of support for reading local repositories for single Ballerina files, the Bala of the module is manually written to the central repository as a workaround. Consequently, the bash script may modify your local Ballerina repositories.

Execute the following commands to build all the examples against the changes you have made to the module locally:

-   To build all the examples:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh build
    ```

-   To run all the examples:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh run
    ```
